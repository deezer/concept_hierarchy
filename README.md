# Learning Unsupervised Hierarchies of Audio Concepts

This repository contains the Python (Tensorflow) code to reproduce the results of our accepted paper ["Learning Unsupervised Hierarchies of Audio Concepts"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.11231.pdf) by D. Afchar, R. Hennequin and V. Guigue, that will be presented at [ISMIR 2022](https://ismir2022.ismir.net/) (December 4-8, 2022).

## Note

**:hammer: This is a work in progress :wrench:**

We provide the algorithmic part of our experiments, which can be already used by interested readers to check implementation details prior to the conference. The code may need a bit of cleaning, which will be done soon enough.

Supposedly, we may be able to upload most training data, but due to copyright issues, we still need to figure out how to properly anonymise everything.

## Result demo

You can access results demos at [research.deezer.com/concept_hierarchy/](http://research.deezer.com/concept_hierarchy/), which include useful interaction visualisation of the obtained graphs, as well as additional figures to help better interpret the (dense) tables of results.
